# NIRF_Dataset

The folder 'PROCESSED_DATA' contains the datasets structured as per the variables required to approximate corresponding undefined parameters.

For example, the file named 'GO_GMS' contains data to approximate the component Median Salary under the Graduation Outcome parameter. For further info, refer to https://www.nirfindia.org/nirfpdfcdn/2022/framework/Engineering.pdf

The file named 'College_Scores' contains the individual scores awarded to the HEIs for the five parameters and their respective components.

The folder 'RAW_DATA' contains the table-wise data segregated as per the number of programs.

If you use data from this repository in a scientific publication, we would appreciate citations to the following paper:
